        <h3>Here's a time line of Taras Shevchenko:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Taras Shevchenko was born on March 9, <strong>1814</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            In the spring of <strong>1838</strong> Karl Bryullov and Vasyl
            Zhukovsky decided to redeem the young poet from serfdom.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the spring of <strong>1845</strong> the poet left for Ukraine,
            where he was going to live and work permanently. In 1846, while in
            Kyiv, he joined the secret Cyril and Methodius Society, which set
            itself the task of spreading education among the Ukrainian people.
          </li>
          <li>
            On April 5, <strong>1847</strong>, 33-year-old Shevchenko was
            arrested for his involvement in this society, and during a search, a
            manuscript of the poem "Dream" was found in his possession. The poet
            was sent to St. Petersburg, interrogations and investigations began.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the beginning of <strong>1857</strong>, the poet's friends
            obtained a royal order for his release.
          </li>
          <li>
            On January 23, <strong>1860</strong>, a new edition of "Kobzar" was
            published, although mutilated in some places by the tsarist
            censorship, but overall much more complete than "Kobzar" of 1840.
          </li>
          <li>
            On September 4, <strong>1860</strong>, the Council of the Academy of
            Arts granted Shevchenko the title of academic engraver. The poet
            worked a lot: he wrote poems, created new engravings, published and
            monitored the distribution of "Primary" - his last book.
          </li>
          <li>
            On March 10, <strong>1861</strong>, the life of T. Shevchenko broke
            off.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote cite="https://osvita.ua/school/biography/91242/">
          <p>
            "...Deceased brother! Your world will be enlightened before
            people... Centuries will pass, and the distant descendants of the
            children of Ukraine will see and know who Taras Shevchenko was.
            Brother, you wanted to live in Kanev - so live until the end of the
            world. And you, Ukraine, devoutly honor our city, because the bones
            of Taras Shevchenko rest here. Here, on one of the highest mountains
            of the Dnieper, his ashes will rest, and as on Mount Calvary, like
            the Lord's cross, a cross will stand, which will be visible on both
            sides of our glorious Dnieper."
